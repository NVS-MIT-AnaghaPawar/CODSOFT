# CODSOFT

Hello I am Anagha Pawar and I am here to explain you about my implementation of Task 1 - NUMBER GAME 

1. You need a JAVA IDE to run the JAVA code. Here I have used JAVA ECLIPSE.
   
2. After setup, I have created a Java Project named "codsoft" and then created a class named "NumberGuessingGame".

3. I have programed the code as per my requirements. Copy and Paste the Java code that I have added.

4. This code is developed in such a way that there are two numbers i.e. Guess number that is provided by the user and Random Number that is generated by the computer randomly, you guess a random number between 1 to 100 and input it in the Console and computer will check whether the guess number is less / greater / equal to the Random number and will display the output.

5. I have limited the attempts to 4, you can also change it as per your choice. After 4th attempt if the user is unsuccessful to guess the number ,it will display 'Sorry you didn't guess the correct number. The number was " ...." ' and if user have guessed the correct number it will display 'Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in "... " attempts'.

6. There is an additional option to play again .If the answer is "y(yes)" enter y and you can play again and if you press "n(no)" it display 'Thanks for playing!'.

   Hope u have liked my project.
   
   Keep learning and keep growing
   
   THANK YOU
